# Complete a Bios

### [Project-0](https://sfkaplan.people.amherst.edu/courses/2024/spring/COSC-277/assignments/project-0.pdf)

Complete the bios to achieve the following

(a) Find the RAM in the physical address space.
(b) Find the second ROM in the physical address space. Both your BIOS and users
of it assume that this second ROM is the kernel.
(c) Copy the kernel (2nd ROM) into main memory (RAM)
(d) Jump to the copied kernelâ€™s first machine code instruction.
