# os-assignments


This is my collection of solved assignments from [COSC-277: Operating Systems](https://sfkaplan.people.amherst.edu/courses/2024/spring/COSC-277/) at Amherst College.

All these assignments are run with the Fivish assembler/simulator that can be found [here](https://gitlab.amherst.edu/sfkaplan/fivish), and its corresponding documentation [here](https://sfkaplan.people.amherst.edu/courses/2024/spring/COSC-277/documents/Fivish-documentation.pdf)
